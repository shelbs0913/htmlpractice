        <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
            <div>Here is what I like about lists:</div>
                <ul>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</ul>
                <u2>That's about it</u2>
                <u3>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</u3>
            <div>When you make a list, do it in this order:</div>
                <ol>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</ol>
                <ol>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise ise th ol tag</ol>
